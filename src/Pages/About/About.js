            <p>
                From the beginning of my B.s.c study, my goal was to be a softwere engineer. And I'm walking to acheive my goal. I'm learning web development in the Programming Hero Community. After finishing that course I'll try to revise the concepts that were a bit confused during the course. Cause learning should be the first destination not only getting a job. After that, I'll try to get a job as junior developer, mostly training concern or internship. As this types of job will help me get used to professional working environment.
